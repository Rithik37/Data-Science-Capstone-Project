The major events of life, personal and professional, are celebrated in restaurants. Acquaintances become friends around a table in the safe and controlled environment of a restaurant. Restaurants are more important than ever. \n\nBeyond the basic purpose of restaurants to provide food and drink, restaurants have fulfilled a human need for connection and shaped social relations. Restaurants occupy an increasingly important place in shaping our overall economy and the nature and makeup of our cities.\n\nRestaurants have always been the leading edge of reshaping neighborhoods.  In certain places, people dine more outside the home.  People do crave  the social experience of dining.  Economy and Employment depend on restaurants in a certain way.\n"
